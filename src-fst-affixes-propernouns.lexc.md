# Meänkieli propernoun morphology

This file documents [`affixes/propernouns.lexc`, the file for Meänkieli propernoun morphology](http://github.com/giellalt/lang-fit/blob/main/src/fst/affixes/propernouns.lexc)

The lexicon napes have 3 parts, divided by "_"
In the first part, **p**  = even syll. proper noun, **3p** in lexicon names = even syll. proper noun
The first part gives the semantic tag. Names that can be both plc and sur are marked plc.
The third part is identical to the number in the `affixes/noun.lexc` file. Thus, **_1** points to the lexicon **x1**, etc.
We do not use **_pl** for names
